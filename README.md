This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

Run npm install and npm install firebase

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## A small Bug
Due to the last-minute changes, accessing forum or profile page before the market page after logging in  is causing a small bug with the market page getting the userId probably because of the asynch nature of the functions, though, that should be easily fixable by modifying some lines of code , we are well aware of the bug and we will fix it as soon as possible . For now, For the app to be tested without bugs, we're assuming you access the market page first after logging in, then any other page.
